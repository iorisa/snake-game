## Implementation approach

We will use the Pygame library to create the game. The game logic will be implemented in a separate file called game.py, and the main entry point of the game will be in main.py.

## File list

- main.py
- game.py

## Data structures and interfaces


classDiagram
    class SnakeGame {
        -int score
        -int speed
        -List<Point> snake_body
        -Point food_position
        +__init__()
        +start_game()
        +update_direction(direction: str)
        +update_game()
        +draw_game()
    }
    class Point {
        -int x
        -int y
        +__init__(x: int, y: int)
    }
    SnakeGame --> Point


## Program call flow


sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant G as SnakeGame
    M->>G: start_game()
    M->>G: update_direction(direction)
    G->>G: update_game()
    G->>G: draw_game()


## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on the game over conditions and how to handle collisions with the snake and the walls.
